# Python Drink Water Reminder

This is a python script that will remind you to drink water every 30 minutes.
The interval can be changed by changing the value of `interval` in `config.ini` (in minutes).

## Requirements

- Python 3 (Tested on Python 3.10)
- Plyer (Tested on Plyer 2.1.0)
- (Optional) Windows's Python Launcher

## Setup

- Install Python if you haven't
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required python package (Plyer) automatically  
   (If you have Windows's Python Launcher installed, you can run `py -3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead)

## Run

#### Without Windows's Python Launcher

```bash
cd DIRPATH # Change DIRPATH into the absolute path of the cloned repository's directory (E.g. C:\Users\user\Documents\python-drink-water-reminder)
python main.pyw
```

#### With Windows's Python Launcher

```bash
cd DIRPATH # Change DIRPATH into the absolute path of the cloned repository's directory (E.g. C:\Users\user\Documents\python-drink-water-reminder)
py -3.10 main.pyw
```

## Run on startup (Windows)

1. Change `<*DIRPATH*>` in `windows-run.bat` into the absolute path of the cloned repository's directory (E.g. `C:\Users\user\Documents\python-drink-water-reminder`)
2. Move the file to Windows's Startup folder (Press Win+R to bring up the Run dialogue and type `shell:startup` to open the Startup folder)
3. It will now run on startup starting from the next time you boot your computer
